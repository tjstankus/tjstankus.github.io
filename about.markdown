Hi, I'm TJ. I began my programming career over 20 years ago by accident. By
hacking together WordPerfect macros to streamline my job as a proofreader, I
discovered I loved programming as much as any creative activity I'd ever pursed.
Today, I teach code, write code, and write about code.

I'm interested in leveraging my deep experience with object-oriented design,
applying it and unlearning it, in equal measure, in the pursuit of timeless
programming and software design knowledge.
